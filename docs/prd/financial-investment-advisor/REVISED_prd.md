# üö® ENTERPRISE REALITY CHECK: Basic Portfolio Tracking Tool - Product Requirements Document

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUSINESS WARNING

**ORIGINAL PROJECT STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE FOR STARTUP - REQUIRES FINTECH ENTERPRISE**

This revision completely transforms the impossible "Financial Investment Advisor" concept into a realistic "Basic Portfolio Tracking Tool" that provides value without requiring Bloomberg terminals, SEC registration, or PhD quantitative analysts.

### Why the Original Concept is Business-Impossible
- **Bloomberg/Refinitiv Licensing**: $24,000+ per terminal annually, minimum enterprise contracts
- **SEC Registration Required**: Investment advisor registration, ongoing compliance costs $500K+ annually
- **Fiduciary Liability**: Personal liability for investment advice, massive malpractice insurance
- **Technical Impossibility**: "Sub-second response for critical functions" requires specialized trading infrastructure
- **Regulatory Nightmare**: Multi-jurisdictional compliance (SEC, FINRA, MiFID II) requires legal teams
- **Team Requirements**: PhD quantitative analysts, compliance officers, regulatory attorneys ($2M+ salaries)
