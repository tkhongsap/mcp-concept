# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LEGAL REVISION: Legal Document Organization Tool - Product Requirements Document

## üö® EXECUTIVE WARNING

**ORIGINAL PROJECT STATUS: EXTREMELY HIGH LEGAL RISK - MAJOR REVISION REQUIRED**

This revision transforms the dangerous "Legal Document Q&A Assistant" into a safe, legally compliant "Legal Document Organization Tool" that provides value without risking unauthorized practice of law violations or massive liability.

### Why the Original Concept is Legally Dangerous
- **Unauthorized Practice of Law**: Providing legal analysis or interpretation violates UPL statutes
- **Professional Liability**: Incorrect legal analysis creates malpractice exposure ($5-10M lawsuits)
- **Regulatory Complexity**: Multi-jurisdictional legal ethics compliance is extremely complex
- **Attorney-Client Privilege**: Handling privileged documents creates confidentiality risks
- **Impossible Accuracy Claims**: "99% citation accuracy" and "95% answer relevance" require legal expert validation

## SAFE ALTERNATIVE: Legal Document Organization & Summary Platform

### Revised Vision
Create a document organization platform that helps legal professionals organize, categorize, and create basic summaries of legal documents - without providing any legal analysis, interpretation, or advice.

### Mission
