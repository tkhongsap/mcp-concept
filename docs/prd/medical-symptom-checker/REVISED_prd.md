# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFETY REVISION: Medical Health Education Tool - Product Requirements Document

## üö® EXECUTIVE WARNING

**ORIGINAL PROJECT STATUS: EXTREMELY DANGEROUS - DO NOT BUILD AS SPECIFIED**

This revision completely transforms the dangerous "Medical Symptom Checker" concept into a safe, legally compliant "Medical Health Education Tool" that provides value without risking human lives or massive legal liability.

### Why the Original Concept is Dangerous
- **Patient Safety Risk**: Misdiagnosis could delay critical care for heart attacks, strokes, appendicitis
- **Legal Liability**: Malpractice lawsuits when AI gives wrong guidance ($10M+ exposure)
- **Regulatory Nightmare**: FDA medical device approval required, 2-5 year process
- **Technical Impossibility**: "85% correlation with clinical assessments" requires clinical trials costing millions
- **Ethical Violation**: Playing doctor without medical training or oversight
