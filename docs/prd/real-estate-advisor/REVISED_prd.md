# üè† DATA ACCESS REALITY CHECK: Simple Property Research Assistant - Product Requirements Document

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DATA WARNING

**ORIGINAL PROJECT STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE DATA ACCESS - COMPETING WITH ZILLOW**

This revision transforms the impossible "Real Estate Advisor" into a realistic "Simple Property Research Assistant" that works with publicly available data and avoids the MLS data access nightmare.

### Why the Original Concept is Data-Impossible
- **MLS Data Access**: $500-2000/month per region, requires real estate license, strict usage restrictions
- **Data Integration Nightmare**: Each MLS has different APIs, formats, access requirements
- **Competitive Suicide**: Competing with Zillow ($8B revenue), Redfin, CoStar with unlimited resources
- **ML Model Fantasy**: "85% price prediction accuracy" requires massive datasets and PhD data scientists
- **Regulatory Complexity**: Real estate licensing requirements, fair housing compliance, appraisal regulations

## Conclusion

The original real estate advisor concept attempted to compete with billion-dollar platforms using expensive MLS data and complex valuation models. This revised approach provides genuine value through organized access to public records and educational property research while operating within realistic budget and legal constraints.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Public Data Focus**: Build on freely available government information
