# üîß COMPLEXITY REALITY CHECK: Simple FAQ Assistant - Product Requirements Document

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL COMPLEXITY WARNING

**ORIGINAL PROJECT STATUS: 8.5/10 DIFFICULTY - NOT FOR JUNIOR DEVELOPERS**

This revision dramatically reduces the scope from an impossible "Technical Product Support Agent" to a realistic "Simple FAQ Assistant" that provides value without requiring enterprise integration complexity.

### Why the Original Concept is Too Complex
- **Integration Nightmare**: 10+ external system integrations (Salesforce, Zendesk, product APIs)
- **Knowledge Management**: Building and maintaining accurate technical knowledge base
- **Multi-System Dependencies**: Cascading failures when any connected system goes down
- **Session State Management**: 1000+ concurrent troubleshooting sessions with complex branching
- **Enterprise Security**: Integration with existing support systems requires enterprise security
- **Team Requirements**: Senior developers with integration expertise, not junior developers
