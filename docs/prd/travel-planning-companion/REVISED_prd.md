# ‚úàÔ∏è API COST REALITY CHECK: Simple Local Travel Guide - Product Requirements Document

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUDGET WARNING

**ORIGINAL PROJECT STATUS: IMPOSSIBLE API COSTS - COMPETING WITH GOOGLE TRAVEL**

This revision transforms the impossible "Travel Planning Companion" into a realistic "Simple Local Travel Guide" focused on a single destination to avoid massive API costs and competition with billion-dollar travel platforms.

### Why the Original Concept is Financially Impossible
- **API Cost Explosion**: 15+ APIs (Amadeus $2.50/request, Google Travel $10K+/month, TripAdvisor $2K/month) = $25K+/month
- **Competitive Suicide**: Competing directly with Google Travel, Expedia ($12B revenue), TripAdvisor (760M reviews)
- **Cultural Intelligence Impossibility**: Maintaining accurate cultural information for 180+ countries requires armies of local experts
- **Technical Complexity**: Multi-objective optimization across 15+ data sources in real-time
- **Timeline Fantasy**: 16 months for junior developers vs. 3-4 years for experienced teams
